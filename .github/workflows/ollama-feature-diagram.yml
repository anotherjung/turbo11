          Create a simple Mermaid sequence diagram showing how this feature works. 

          Focus on:
          - What the user does
          - What the system does
          - Key steps in order
          - Any important interactions

          Keep it simple and clear - just the main flow of this feature.

          Format as:
          ```mermaid
          sequenceDiagram
              participant User
              participant System
              User->>System: Does something
              System-->>User: Returns result
          ```

          Make the diagram easy to understand for anyone reviewing the PR.
